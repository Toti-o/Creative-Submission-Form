# Creative-Submission-Form
This project contains a single HTML file, enhanced-form.html, which demonstrates a complete and accessible HTML5 form designed for creative professionals to submit their work. The page includes a clear structure with lists, tables, and media to organize information and make the content engaging. The form itself uses various input types and HTML5 validation features such as required fields, placeholders, patterns, and minlength rules to ensure accurate submissions. It could be used by an art gallery, film festival, or design competition to collect participant details, creative specialties, and portfolio files in an organized and user-friendly way.
